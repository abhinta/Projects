NOTE:
1. abhinav == Abhinav for database
2.
pintable and citytable are independent databases.
Think in terms of application, patient searches a doctor on the basis of city or pin or both. But, there can be spelling difference in cities of both dbs.


pincode db doesn't have :
Telangana...skipped
Odisha...altered
Ladakh...skipped
//Andaman & Nicobar Islands...altered
Lakshadweep replaced from laskhdweep

pincode db is independent of state btw...so no worries

cities doesn't have :
Telangana...skipped
Lakshdweep...Lakshadweep
Odisha...altered
Ladakh...skipped

A (Possible) amendment in file uploading can be done as:
1. separate folders for slips, doctor profile pics, certi ppics, etc.
2. To avoid overwriting of images with same name...a query can be executed telling no. of images with same name (like query 14105.jpg, 14105(1).jpg, 14105(2).jpg)...(ans would be either 0 or more) -> solution: attach ($count+1) with this image
    2.1.But we need to take care at databse side of the length of (say) ppic -> if it was originally 40 characters, make it 43 maybe; although asking users to input length of 40 only
3. Whenever person inputs a number...it may include 'e'
    3.1. first database must have varchar length extended
    3.2. or simply give error if the string is in scientific notation
4. When we input sugar results, we can ask user to switch between units
